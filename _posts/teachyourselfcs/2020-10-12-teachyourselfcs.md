What do I know about CS
-----------------

Well I attended a private research insitution and 27 credits left in my CS bachelors degree?

Do I recommend college
-----------------------
yeah student loans etc etc
I think if you are able to go to college and are in the mindset to put all your focus in school, do it

I cant cover all edge cases in this small blog post but I can say that certain institutions do have better education thn other.

I often find myself looking at projects CMU or UIUC students make and I am like fuck, lets step it up
I know that comparing yourself to others is bad you dont have to tell me. I am a very competitive person.
I enjoy helping others, I am not a cockhead.


How to approach learning CS
-------------------

I think there are so many resources available for free. I think learning the basics in a language like C/Java/C++ is important.
You could learn in scheme if you want but I think thats unncessecary.
Learn datastructures and algorithms in that language.
If you want to be a hack3r leet bro
I like knowing computers from top down. 
I would suggest learning linux by using mint, it made my transistion to ubuntu so soft and gentle.
You can use mac or windows, nothing bad is about those just dont use gentoo and fall for the memes.

Linux is a powerful tool, you will always find something you can go more indepth with.
