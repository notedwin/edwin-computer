Howdy again.

One of my classes required a book from independant publisher.
This independan publisher sold PDF for cheaper than the hard cover book.
Gotta save all my pennies.

I didnt have adobe digital editions on my linux device, nor did i want to download it.
I asked my girlfriend to use her Mac to use abobe digital editions.
I however at the time didnt know that you can only use adobe didgital editions on one device.

Now I am in a sea of complexities.

The catch is that I can only read it from adobe digital editions.
How Dull.

I decided to remove the DRM so I could read the book on any of my devces.

Removing DRM isn't something easily found by a simple google search. 
Nor is anything of practical value.
I luckily found a tool to remove DRM from DeDRM.

The tool uses python2 and relies on Adobe digital editions 2.0.
I am not an expert in the tool.

You have to generate the keys.


I have a goal to modernize it but it is a very big library.
