## HACKERS?

## Okay maybe not the sterotypical hackers.

## Before I show what I attempetd I would like to clarify SSH.

SSH stands for secure shelll which is often used to allow computers to talk to eachother. SSH is used to access remote machines and administration tasks.

Most devices are not vunerable to SSH attacks but if you open up a port to allow remote acces syou could have someone running a SSH brute force attack.



# How do I know who is trying to hack me?

Logs. Logs capture verything that changes in the system. For our specific scenario we have /var/log/auth.log that captures all of our attackers.

There are differnt ways we can then show this graphically so I skipped sending the logs, which my downfall.

I can easily map the lat and longitude using flask.



# Where did I mess up. I spent so much time looking at different ways to visualize the data that I did not realize rsyslog did not work on my raspberry pi. To e fair i had to download it from an openssue repo.
