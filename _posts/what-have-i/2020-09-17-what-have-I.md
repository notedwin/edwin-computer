I learned alot about programming considering I earned how to program using an hour of code 
Ididnt learn basic any actual language I learned thrugh logic blocks.
I would spend all my time using MITappInventor2 creating apps for my phone(gosh i wish i still had an android.)
I learned java fter that in CSAPA, Learning java i had a focus on graphics but I was intrested in linux and kali as I saw movies like stuxnet etc.
My senior year my grandma gave me 50 bucks and decided to buy a raspberry pi and install linux and keyboard and mosuse. I wasnt able to do much programming since the IT department locked the laptops to not allow software installation. I had the password but I would never abuse that power. Plus i was a plebian.
College hit and BOY was I bombarded with terms I had never heard nor understood, what the hell is gdb, whats a vim and emacs, I though I was going to learn python and electrnics(guess i didnt do enough research).
I found my footing that didnt reallly mean my grades execeled i am terrible at spreading out actions over a long period i really just binge doing my work. I work like that.
Now, I feel confient in what I can and cant do and also what I want to learn.
Shortcuts don't exists.

This is all related to my career, I have learned more about myself in other areas but I try to keep my personal life seperate from my carrer.

What hobbies do you have?
I try riding my bike for atleast an hour, I run once every couple months but my condition is nowhere near where i used to be, thats ok, programming is a very time consuming and seintary life-style, 
My girlfriend and I like exploring places and go on atleast 2 dates a week to either a park or somewhere.
I try to not play too much pubg mobile, I have always had 1 phone game i am addicted to. I used to play clash of clans, clash royale, etc. Those games are fun for blowing time on a bus or on your way somehere.

i consider myself a good awful programming who cant code to save his life but I try coding something up daily.
I really enjoy the shell, my second home, even if something has ana easier way of installation i like seeing if i can do it with the shell.

I maintain my home network with the college students, we dont blow through all our data but we do use alot of data(mainly me last month i used 500Gb yeah im not proud of that I need to get off the internet.)

message to old friends: 
Feel free to message me I dont really have that much going on okay maybe i do but im more willing to reply than i was a couple months ago.

I have always kept my life private, heck i havent posted on social media in a couple months my friends probably think im dead or depressed. I a neither im health alive, purely vibing, jusst working on myself and overworking myself alot of the time(i wrote this while taking a break from the 3 assignements i have due at midnight)

All the choices I have made are for the better of me. I amembarrased of the persona, I was but I am happy i was that person.

I work at (Ideashop)[ideashop.iit.edu] as a web-developer, thats my title but rrealistically anything computer related I do. I used to work at [ots](https://ots.iit.edu).
I planned on getting an internship but i know i was not prepared for that. We will try to get one summer 2021, i graduate in fall 2021 so hopefully that internship leads to a full time offer, even if i dont accept it It would be good to know that I am employable.
Grinding leetcode and system design. 

If anyone wants to fund me, i dont really need anything I have all my nessecities but buying a good camera is a huge expense, good being alive is expensive. 

Guides:
How to learn CS:
There are alot of resources but dont get stuckk trying to learn one language and master it that isnt what cs is, its being able to decompose a problem into something you know how to attack.
There is subjectivity in that staement but I truly beileve being able to decompose.

Hobbies:
Cooking
