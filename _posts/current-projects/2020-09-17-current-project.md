Hello, My previous website is still up but at a different domain.
[old site](https://old.edwin.computer)
I host all this on my personal nginx server on raspberry pi 3b+. Looking to upgrade it to a pi 4 with 4 or 8gb so i can host gitea and just experiment with more things. I have a desktop but it can be a little incosistent, i would rather keep it for only work and light gaming. 

Currently learning:
More python
More pen testing and ethical hacking
Electronics

Do not want to touch with a 10 foot pole:
Javascript.

Just kididng its okay, just the framework create so much overhead for me, i like understanding why something works not just making using a module and calling it a day.
