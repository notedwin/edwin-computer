For my old website , I used gatsby and i hadnt yet learned what CI/CD was i just heard it in passing.
I used a website named ziet by vercel which automatically deploys my application.

I thought it was really cool and unique but its just a web application that does the job of jenkins.

I learned how to use jenkins by doing some googling and looking at documentation.
