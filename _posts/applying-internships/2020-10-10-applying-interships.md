I am current looking for an intership for this winter or summer 2021.

Preparing for interview
-------------------

A sane person would start preparing by doing leetcode attending hackathons, networking, linkedin etc.

I attended one hackathon and realized its about having a diverse team and group of people you enjoy working with
I worked with the rest of the catch all and I really didnt have too much fun some people over complicated the app that could have been simple and nice, I was just there to fuck around with react native.

After that I started making my personal website, at the time i stuck to pure HTML then JS then jekyll.

Networking is fun if your working on soemthing intresting and can share ideas but going to a class work heavy school makes you mourn interaction.

What is my process for finding internships to apply to?
-------------------

I am only looking for paid internships, if I had the monetary means I would have taken unpaid internships if I couldnt get paid internships as a freshman or sophmore. 
Hey atleast you know.



I current am using leetcode and famous algorithms.


Where do you find internships?
-----------------

Apart from schools
At work, I am learning about python and just maintiaing projects, while working on backend 

Currently learning on da side:
Strengthing my coding by coding every dam day
More python, I want to make python my main language
Electronics

What are my main projects
---------------------
Well my classes are my main focus then work then anything else

Right now I am working on a Django web application for CS487.
I made a django application in CS425, its on my portfolio
I made it in 1 week so I am hoping I can make something really nice in 1 semester.

Work I want to make a backend application.
Add documentation for certain of our main applications
Do any infastrcture updates for our company

LAst on my list is clean up my python, algorithms and data structures since I am in the process of applying for interships. I had one difficult ass interview.
I will make a post for applying to internships and what I use.
