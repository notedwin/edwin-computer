Tech:  
[ThinkPad T480s](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-t-series/ThinkPad-T480s/p/22TP2TT480S) - Ubuntu 20.04, no modifications(yet).

I have a desktop for work and small gaming:  
I5-6600k with GTX970 with a single monitor because monitors are expensive.  
It runs GTA5 thats all that matters to me.

Software I recommend:
- [Github Student Developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) 
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for programming smaller projects
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for work and managing a python web applications
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for terminal stuff
- [figma](https://www.figma.com)

Websites i check too often:
- [ycombinator](https://news.ycombinator.com)

music:
I by no means have good music taste, but I like what I like.
