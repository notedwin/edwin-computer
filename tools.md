Link to most recent update

Pandemic sucks. Forced back home i felt like I was 18 again and that never feels good. Decided to get an appartment in the city with a couple roommates. Bought a bike. Started cooking more.

While i was at home, I remodelled my room because my mom decided it would be fun. Binged Leetcode and project euler to learn python. Reignited my obession with privacy + freedom of speech and data after many police stations took down their case data. Tried running but my body is weak
