---------
This is my personal website.

I have multiple other websites but they were for projects. This is solely out of interest to run a blog.

This Blog is meant to document some of the things I do related to tech.

Theme:

I did not generate all of the code, I used a theme as a starting point and made it my own.

Klis√© is minimalist Jekyll theme for running a personal site and blog running on Jekyll.<br>
For demo <a href="https://klise.now.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">klise.now.sh</a>
