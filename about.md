Howdy! I am Edwin Zamudio.

I am currently studying computer science as an undergraduate student @ [Illinois Tech](https://www.iit.edu). I am actively seeking an internship where I can showcase my current skills, and further expand my skills set as a software developer.

I have multiple years of programming experience in C, Java, Python. I love working with Python and C, BASH. I am currently intrested in DevOps, embedded systems. 

At a fundamental level, I am a fast learner and can adapt to any environment.

Here are a few technologies I can work with confidently:
- Python
- C/C++
- Java
- SQL
