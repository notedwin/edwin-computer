Howdy! I am Edwin Zamudio.

I am currently studying computer science as an undergraduate student @ Illinois Tech. I am actively seeking an internship where I can showcase my current skills. Also, where I can further expand my skills set as a software developer.

I have 3+ years of programming experience in C and Java. I have been working towards reaching the same level of mastery in Python and JavaScript.

At a fundamental level, I am a fast learner and can adapt to any environment.

Here are a few technologies I can work with confidently:
    .*Python
    .*C/C++
    .*Java
    .*SQL

You can [report](http://github.com/edwin-computer/issues/new) if there is an broken link(s) or somethings else.

In 2018, I had recently finished highschool and I made a goal of making a website to blog about the different things I was doing. I didnt forget I just had more things going on. Luckily, I wrote most of these things down in a journal or the ol trusty notes app.
