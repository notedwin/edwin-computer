Howdy! I am Edwin Zamudio.

I am currently studying computer science as an undergraduate student @ [Illinois Tech](https://www.iit.edu). I am actively seeking an internship where I can showcase my current skills, and further expand my skills set as a software developer.

I have multiple years of programming experience in C, Java, Python. I love working with Python and Linux. I am currently interested in distribution computing.

At a fundamental level, I am a fast learner and can adapt to any environment.

Here are a few technologies I can work with confidently:

- Python
- Linux
- SQL
- JavaScript
- Java
- C/C++
