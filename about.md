Howdy! I am Edwin.

I am a senior studying Computer Science at [Illinois Tech](https://www.iit.edu).  

I am actively seeking an full-time software engineering position to start after May 2022 where I can showcase my current skills, and further expand my skills set as a software engineer.

During the school semesters, I keep myself busy by working on multiple production Flask applications for Illinois Tech's Idea Shop which helps manage students at our campus maker space. If I am not working at the Idea Shop, I am working on personal projects or attending hackathons.  

Iâ€™m interested in improving the efficiency, scalability and security of back-end applications and infrastructure.  

I have multiple years of programming experience in C, Java, Python. I love working with Python and Linux.
