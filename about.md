Howdy! I am Edwin Zamudio.

I am currently studying computer science as an undergraduate student @ [Illinois Tech](https://www.iit.edu). I am actively seeking an internship where I can showcase my current skills, and further expand my skills set as a software developer.

I have multiple years of programming experience in C, Java, Python. I love working with Python and C, BASH. I am currently interested in DevOps, embedded systems.

At a fundamental level, I am a fast learner and can adapt to any environment.

Here are a few technologies I can work with confidently:

- Python
- C/C++
- Java
- SQL

You can [report](http://github.com/edwin-computer/issues/new) if there is a broken link(s) or something else.

## Services I recommend

I have a desktop for work and small gaming:  
I5-6600k with GTX970 with a single monitor because monitors are expensive.  
It runs GTA5 thats all that matters to me.
